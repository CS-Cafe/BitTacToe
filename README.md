# BitTacToe
 
Minimalist tic tac toe project. An excuse to bit-twiddle!  

### ***A bit of explanation:***
The magic numbers used to check for victory are segments of a 512-bit map. Here, each of the 512 states of a single bitboard are assigned a score of 0 or 1 depending on whether the state is terminal.
