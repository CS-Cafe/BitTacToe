# BitTacToe
 
Minimalist tic tac toe project. An excuse to bit-twiddle! Some inspiration: The magic 64-bit bitmaps could be stored as an array of 32 bit integers instead. An implementation like this might yield slightly faster victory checks due to shorter shifts...

(*Sorry in advance for the magic numbers. I intend to replace them with named constants.*)
